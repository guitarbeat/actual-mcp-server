// #324: the six pre-flight controls that decide whether the @actual-app/api
// release train may run tonight. Extracted into a script, rather than added as
// workflow steps, for two reasons:
//
//  1. FOURTEEN places in dependency-update.yml consume
//     `steps.versions.outputs.update_needed`. A new step emitting its own output
//     would leave all fourteen gates reading the old one and the train would
//     proceed despite a denylist hit. This script keeps `update_needed` with its
//     exact existing name and semantics, so that diff is zero lines.
//  2. workflow_release_guards.test.js is a TEXT parser. It cannot execute a
//     step's shell, so logic living in a `run:` block cannot be unit tested. The
//     denylist is a two-sided contract, and an untested one fails silently in
//     precisely the situation it exists for: mid-incident, nobody reading closely.
//
// Mirrors the scripts/report-train-failure.mjs shape: pure exported decision
// functions, thin I/O layer behind a direct-invocation check.
//
// CONTROL ORDER IS LOAD BEARING. See decidePreflight.

 *
 *  #440: lowered from 48 to 24. The soak exists because a bad upstream release
 *  is typically yanked within 24 to 72 hours and this is an unattended nightly
 *  job, so 24h sits at the LOW end of that range and catches fewer yanks than 48
 *  did. That is an accepted trade, made deliberately: `.github/actual-api-denylist.txt`
 *  (control 5) remains the REACTIVE backstop for a bad release that slips through,
 *  while the cost of the longer window was paid by users. #427 is the instance:
 *  26.9.0 published 2026-09-01 08:56Z, a reporter upgraded their Actual server
 *  inside our window, and their 26.9.0 server met our still-26.8.1 bundled API.
 *
 *  What this actually buys is a third, not a half. The train is NIGHTLY, so the
 *  real lag is this floor PLUS up to one cron interval, moving the worst case
 *  from (48,72]h to (24,48]h. For #427 specifically, 64.4h becomes 40.4h.
 *
 *  NOT to be confused with STALE_THRESHOLD_HOURS in report-train-stale.mjs,
 *  which is also 48 and is unrelated: that one is the #327 liveness threshold
 *  and its value encodes "tolerates exactly one missed nightly cron". */

 *    check take its else branch and report a quiet "refusing to downgrade".
 *    Validity is the only control whose disposition is RED; direction is silent.
 *    The wrong order turns a multi-night registry outage into total silence,
 *    which is verbatim the defect #325 exists to eliminate.
 *  - EQUALITY BEFORE DIRECTION. Two equal values make `sort -V | tail -1` return
 *    that value, which equals LATEST, so update_needed would fire and the train
 *    would branch, run a no-op install, bump, and publish a release containing no
 *    dependency change, every single night.
 *  - DENYLIST BEFORE SOAK. A version that is both denylisted and young must
 *    report `denied`, not `soaking`. The soak clears itself; the denylist does
 *    not. Reporting "soaking" would leave an operator waiting for a publish that
