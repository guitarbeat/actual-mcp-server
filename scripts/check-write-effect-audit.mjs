/**
 * #362: report when docs/audit/write-effect-audit.md is stale, and NEVER fail.
 *
 * The audit records which write tools can report success for an upstream call that did
 * nothing. Every disposition in it is a claim about one specific `@actual-app/api`
 * version, recorded in the file as `<!-- audited-api-version: X.Y.Z -->`. The release
 * train bumps that dependency on a schedule, so the document rots without anybody
 * touching it.
 *
 * WHY THIS CANNOT FAIL THE BUILD, EVER.
 *
 * #321: a check whose result changes with no commit used to live in the unit suite. An
 * upstream release turned it red, the auto-release train died for two nights, and a
 * security PR sat blocked behind a failure nobody had caused. The signal was real; the
 * placement was wrong. This script reports and exits 0, and it belongs in the
 * non-blocking api-surface-drift lane, never in `test:unit-js`.
 *
 * Exit code is 0 in every path, including a missing or malformed document. A staleness
 * reminder that can break a pipeline is worse than no reminder.
