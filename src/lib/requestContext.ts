/**
 * Per-request AsyncLocalStorage. Carries the active MCP sessionId and the
 * allow-listed budget sync IDs across async boundaries so adapter / tool
 * code can identify the request without threading arguments through every
 * layer.
 *
 * Producer: src/server/httpServer.ts wraps each `transport.handleRequest()`
 * call in `requestContext.run({ sessionId, allowedBudgets }, …)`.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   * src/lib/actual-adapter.ts: pool-vs-legacy branch decision via
 *     `requestContext.getStore()?.sessionId` (see #134).
 *   * src/lib/actual-adapter.ts: ACL enforcement at the top of withActualApi
 *     via `requestContext.getStore()?.allowedBudgets` (see #156).
 *
 * Lives in src/lib/ rather than src/server/ to avoid the circular import that
 * would otherwise exist between httpServer.ts and actual-adapter.ts.
 *
 * Note: `allowedBudgets` semantics mirror the budget-acl middleware output.
 * `['*']` means unrestricted; `[]` means no access. When `allowedBudgets` is
 * undefined (e.g. stdio mode or no requestContext.run wrapper), the adapter
 * falls back to its trusted-local short-circuit when AUTH_PROVIDER is not
 * 'oidc'.

  // httpServer.ts, so a stdio entry would never be touched, would expire after
  // SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES, and cleanupIdleConnections would tear it down. Since #392 that
  // teardown takes the api mutex and re-checks expiry, so it is no longer a mid-operation hazard,
  // but an entry that is never refreshed still expires, and that is the reason stdio stays off
  // the pool.
  // Keeping stdio off the pooled branch entirely is simpler and safer than
  // teaching the pool a second liveness model.
