/**
 * Predicate for the unhandledRejection allow-list in src/index.ts.
 *
 * Returns true when a rejection should be logged but the server should keep
 * running. Centralised here so it can be unit-tested without importing the
 * full server entrypoint.
 *
 * INVARIANT: this module MUST remain side-effect-free.
 *
 * src/index.ts registers the process.on('unhandledRejection', ...) handler
 * AFTER importing this module (ESM static imports are evaluated before the
 * top-level body runs). Any side effect introduced here, e.g. importing a
 * logger that performs winston/file-handle init, importing dotenv, or any
 * code that runs at module load, opens a window during ESM evaluation in
 * which an unhandled rejection bypasses this allow-list and crashes the
 * server. That is exactly the latent regression the #152 fix was meant to
 * prevent.
 *
 * Concretely:
 *   - No imports (static, dynamic, require, await import) of project modules.
 *   - Only node: builtins are permitted, and only if strictly necessary.
 *   - No top-level statements other than function/export declarations.
 *
 * Enforcement: tests/unit/rejection-allowlist-purity.test.js parses this
 * source file and exits non-zero if any forbidden construct is present, or
 * if the sentinel below is missing. The sentinel makes deletion of this
 * docblock a hard-fail at CI time.

 *
 * The secondary rejection is an Error whose only set property is `stack`

 * are on the PRIMARY error which ActualConnectionPool already catches).
 * Anchoring on the stack alone is therefore the correct signal.

 *   - 'download-budget': the precise frame for today's known trigger.
 *   - '@actual-app/api/dist': the durable path anchor; survives upstream
 *     handler renames as long as the package is still loaded from a
 *     conventional npm install path.
