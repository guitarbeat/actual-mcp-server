/**
 * #355. `adapter.holdBudgetForNextMonth` reads `forNextMonth` before and after the write and
 * returns the amount ACTUALLY held, because upstream can do less than asked in two ways: it
 * holds nothing when the month has no positive To Budget, and it silently CLAMPS the hold to
 * whatever is left. A boolean catches the first and misses the second.
 *
 * #371 moved that logic into the adapter from this file. This tool owns the schema and the
 * wording of the three answers: held in full, held in part, held nothing.
