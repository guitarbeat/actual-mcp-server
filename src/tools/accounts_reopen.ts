 * #358. The guard lives in `adapter.reopenAccount`, which reads, writes and re-reads inside

 * in #347.
 *
 * #371 moved it there from this file. The read-then-write property never needed the raw
 * api: doing it in the adapter keeps `retry` on the reads, keeps one observability call
 * site, and leaves no unguarded `adapter.reopenAccount` for a future caller to reach for.
 *
 * #369 item 5: an already-open account is now reported as a non-change and issues NO write.
 * Upstream's reopen is a db.update, which in Actual is a CRDT message that syncs to every
 * client, so a no-op write is real sync traffic.
