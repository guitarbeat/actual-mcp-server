/**
 * #347: this tool used to return `{success: true}` unconditionally, which was a
 * lie for CLOSED accounts.
 *
 * Verified in upstream source. `api.deleteAccount(id)` maps to
 * `account-close({id, forced: true})`, and `closeAccount` opens with:
 *
 *   const account = await db.first('SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = ? AND tombstone = 0', [id]);
 *   if (!account || account.closed === 1) return;      // <- silent no-op
 *
 * So a closed account is a no-op with no error, and the tool reported success
 * anyway. Confirmed against a live server: nine deletions all reported success
 * and the seven closed ones survived.
 *
 * WHY VERIFY AFTER, NOT CHECK BEFORE. The obvious fix is to look the account up
 * first and refuse if it is closed. That breaks a case which looks identical from
 * here but is not: `closeAccount` DELETES (tombstones) an account that has zero
 * transactions, and `reopenAccount` only clears the `closed` flag, never the
 * tombstone. `getAccounts()` filters `tombstone = 0`, so a close-then-reopen
 * leaves an id that no longer appears in any listing. A pre-check would call that
 * "not found" and throw, where the caller's intent (make this account not exist)
 * is in fact already satisfied. The repo's own teardown idiom does exactly this:
 * close first, then delete.
 *
 * Verifying AFTER answers the question the caller actually asked, "is it gone?",
 * rather than a proxy for it. It also closes a race the pre-check could not: the
 * read and the write land in different sessions, so a concurrent close could
 * commit between them and reproduce the original false success.
 *
 * The deliberate consequence is that deleting an id that never existed still
 * reports success. That is idempotent-delete semantics, it matches the behaviour
 * before this change, and the post-condition ("no account with this id exists")
 * is true either way.
