// #378: per-drain listing memoisation, and the sibling-operation ordering property.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every read-then-write guard the adapter gained in #356, #359, #360,
// #361 and #371 opens with a full entity listing. Two consequences were reported, and a third
// was found while reproducing them:
//
//   1. COST. A guarded write pays an O(n) listing inside the api mutex. Reproduced before the
//      fix: two guarded updates in ONE drain cost TWO listings.
//   2. FALSE NOT-FOUND. A create and an update in the same drain raced, so the update could be
//      refused for an entity the sibling had just created.
//   3. THE GUARD FAILING OPEN, which the ticket did not mention and which is the serious one.
//      A delete and an update of the SAME entity in one drain: the update's pre-read saw the
//      entity, the guard passed, and the raw write then ran against a deleted row. Per #360
//      the CRDT apply path INSERTs when the row is absent, so that is the phantom partial row
//      the guard exists to prevent. It reproduced at EVERY timing, including a zero-delay
//      delete, so it did not depend on a lucky interleaving.
//
// THE TWO MECHANISMS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, which is the thing to keep straight when
// editing this. Memoisation makes the reads cheap and mutually consistent. It does NOT order
// them, and 2 and 3 are ordering problems: a read that happens before a sibling's write is
// equally wrong whether it came from a cache or the database. Sequential dispatch is what
// fixes those. Deleting either mechanism silently reopens one class, so both are pinned here.
