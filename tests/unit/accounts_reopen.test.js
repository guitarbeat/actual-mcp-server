// never let the raw reopen run for one.
//
// The bug this guards is not a mere false success. Upstream `reopenAccount` is a bare
// `db.update('accounts', {id, closed: 0})`, `db.update` sends CRDT messages, and the
// apply path INSERTs when the row was absent, so reopening an unknown id CREATES a
// nameless account that is visible in listings and syncs to other clients. The
// assertion that matters is therefore `rawReopenAccount` NOT being called.
