//
// #349: an import changes which budget is loaded, so the connection pool's record
// of the loaded syncId must stop naming the previous one.
//
// THE BUG THIS PINS. switchBudget's #172 fast path skips the re-download when
// `currentEntry.syncId === found.syncId`, trusting that field as the record of
// what is loaded. importBudget never updated it, so a switch BACK to the
// configured budget hit the fast path, returned `{success: true}`, and left the
// session on the imported copy. Subsequent writes and deletes then landed in the
// WRONG BUDGET while the caller believed the switch happened.
//
// The assertion that matters is the last one: a switch after an import must
// actually re-download. Asserting only that updateLoadedSyncId was called would
// pass even if the fast path still matched.
//
// Run: node tests/unit/budgets_import_syncid.test.js
