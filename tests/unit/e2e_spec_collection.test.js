//
// #382: every `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts` must be collected by at least one Playwright project.
// #384: and COLLECTED IS NOT RUN, so this file now checks both.
//
// The #384 defect in one sentence: a guard that says "collected" gets read as "runs". Had #382
// been fixed by adding a `stdio-tests` project rather than by moving the assertions into the unit
// chain, this guard would have gone green while the file still executed nowhere, which is the same
// defect one level up and with a guard actively certifying it.
//
// So the second check partitions every spec into RUNS-IN-CI or DECLARED-MANUAL. The set of
// projects CI actually runs is read from `tests/e2e/run-docker-e2e.sh`, which is where that truth
// lives (both workflows invoke `test:e2e:docker:full`, which is that script). Parsing one shell
// script is deliberate: the ticket weighed parsing workflow YAML and called it brittle, and it
// would be, because it couples this test to job names. The script is the narrow waist.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `tests/e2e/stdio.spec.ts` contained three real tests and was matched by
// no `testMatch` in either config, so it never executed once from the day it was added. It
// was not a near miss: it sat there while #366 removed `tests/e2e/suites/` for exactly the
// same defect, and while CLAUDE.md described it as live E2E coverage.
//
// Nothing could have caught it:
//   - Playwright documents no mechanism for reporting a spec file no project collects, and
//     does not warn. A file matched by nothing is simply absent from the run.
//   - `knip.json` declares `tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts` as an ENTRY pattern, so knip treats
//     every spec as a reachable root by definition and the blocking dead-code gate
//     structurally cannot see this class.
//
// WHY A DEDICATED GUARD RATHER THAN NARROWING THE KNIP PATTERN, which was the first
// instinct and is recorded here so it is not re-litigated. Narrowing `knip.json` to the
// collected specs would work, but it reports "unused file", which reads as "delete this"
// rather than "no project collects this", and it produces a FALSE failure whenever someone
// adds a spec AND wires it up correctly, until knip.json is also edited. This guard has
// neither problem: it stays quiet when a spec is properly collected, and when it fires it
// names the actual fix.
//
// Run: node tests/unit/e2e_spec_collection.test.js
