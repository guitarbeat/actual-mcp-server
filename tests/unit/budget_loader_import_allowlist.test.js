// #402: make the "nothing in budgetLoader.ts takes withApiLock" invariant STRUCTURAL.
//
// After #396, `loadBudgetTracked` is called from inside the api lock at all six budget load
// sites, and `withApiLock` (src/lib/apiLock.ts) is a NON-REENTRANT mutex (an affinity queue since #391). So a future edit
// that reaches the api through `adapter.getBudgetMonths()` or `adapter.getBudgets()` instead of
// the raw `api.*` deadlocks the whole process.
//
// The symptom is the reason this deserves a guard rather than a comment: a roughly 30 second
// stall followed by `Actual API operation timed out after 30000ms`, which reads as a slow
// upstream server rather than as the nesting bug it is.
//
// #396 states the invariant in prose and its gate accepted that. This file is the structural
// version, because this project has paid for the difference four times: #371, #376, #390 and
// #393 each found a guard missed at a call site, four rounds running in #390's case.
//
// DELIBERATE LIMITATION, recorded so nobody mistakes this for more than it is: this catches a new
// STATIC import. It does NOT catch a dynamic `await import(...)` inside a function body, which is
// a real shape in this codebase (transactions_summary_by_payee.ts uses it to reach the query
// builder). The file has none today, so the absence is asserted too, which closes that gap for as
// long as it stays absent.
//
// Run: node tests/unit/budget_loader_import_allowlist.test.js
