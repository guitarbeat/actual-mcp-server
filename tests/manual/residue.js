/**
 * residue.js
 *
 * #280: the SINGLE source of truth for "is this object test residue?", plus the
 * sweep and the zero-residue assertion. `cleanup.js` and `runner.js` both delegate
 * here, so detection cannot drift between them.
 *
 * WHY A NAME SHAPE, NOT A PREFIX LIST
 * -----------------------------------
 * cleanup.js used to enumerate 5 prefixes. The test modules generate 31 distinct
 * name templates across 19+ prefixes, so the enumeration silently missed most of
 * them, which is how MCP-Payee-* payees accumulated in the dev budget for months.
 * Matching the machine-generated NAME SHAPE covers every current prefix and every
 * future one, and it refuses to match a human-created "MCP-Test" or "MCP-Budget"
 * account, because those carry no timestamp.
 *
 * TWO DETECTION PATHS
 * -------------------
 * 1. Named objects (accounts, payees, categories, category groups, schedules) are
 *    matched by TEST_OBJECT_RE against their `name`.
 * 2. RULES HAVE NO NAME. They are matched by a condition whose `value` starts with
 *    RULE_MARKER_PREFIX. Those markers are static (`MCP-Rule-test-marker`), carry no
 *    timestamp, and are therefore correctly REJECTED by TEST_OBJECT_RE. Do not
 *    "fix" that by loosening the regex: it would start matching human names.
 *
 * SAFETY
 * ------
 * sweepResidue() DELETES against a live budget. It refuses to run unless the caller
 * has designated the budget as disposable and that designation matches the budget the
 * server actually has loaded. See assertSweepAllowed().
