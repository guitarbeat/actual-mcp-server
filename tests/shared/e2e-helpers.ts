/**
 * A client-side pacer that keeps this suite under Actual's request ceiling BY CONSTRUCTION.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS, measured rather than guessed. Actual applies
 * `rateLimit({ windowMs: 60_000, max: 500 })` to every request (in its bundled `app.js`,
 * guarded by `NODE_ENV !== "development"`). We cannot simply switch the fixture to
 * development: that makes the server proxy to a React dev server it does not ship, and it
 * exits at boot with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND on `http-proxy-middleware`.
 *
 * A full run of `docker-all-tools.e2e.spec.ts` puts 569 requests on that server, counted
 * from the Actual container's own log. Since #375 every test provisions and tears down its
 * own data, which is what pushed it there.
 *
 * So the suite is over the ceiling in TOTAL, and whether it trips depends only on how
 * tightly the requests bunch. Locally the run takes about 66 seconds and no single 60s
 * window quite reaches 500, so it passes. On a CI runner the same work finishes in 47
 * seconds, nearly every request lands inside one window, and everything from roughly the
 * 500th request onward fails with `PostError: Too many requests` for reasons unrelated to
 * what those tests assert. That is the inverted signal #375 exists to remove.
 *
 * WHY NOT RETRY. The first attempt at this backed off and retried the throttled call. That
 * is wrong for a CREATE, which is not idempotent: the write had already landed, so the retry
 * came back with `A 'E2E-Group-...' category group already exists.` Pacing has no such
 * hazard, because no request is ever sent twice.
 *
 * The budget is counted in TOOL CALLS, because that is what this layer can see. The AVERAGE
 * ratio is about 1.4 Actual requests per tool call, but it is not uniform: a write call is
 * op + sync (2 requests) and a read is 1, so a write-heavy BLOCK (the transactions and budgets
 * runs) peaks near 1.8. At 300 calls that block reached ~540 requests and tripped the limiter
 * (#383: 2 stdio failures at spec lines 686 to 697, over the SYNC path, after #422 removed the
 * relogin cascade that had masked the real ratio). 230 calls at 1.8 is ~415 requests, inside
 * 500 with margin, at the cost of a longer wall clock. The stdio leg is the tighter one: it
 * runs host-side over docker exec and never reached the old 300 budget, so lowering it is what
 * actually engages the pacer there.
 */
const RATE_WINDOW_MS = 60_000;

/**
 * #423: the budget is PER TRANSPORT, because the two legs amplify a tool call very differently.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-06, with the stdio leg on its OWN Actual server (so nothing else was
 * consuming its window): the leg makes about 112 tool calls in 2.4 minutes, never comes close to
 * the 230 budget, and STILL trips the 500-requests-per-minute limiter about 90 seconds in. That
 * disproves the shared-window explanation this file and #423 both carried: the overflow is
 * request AMPLIFICATION inside one leg, not two legs sharing a ceiling.
 *
 * Why stdio amplifies harder than HTTP, from the adapter: stdio never gets a pool entry (that is
 * deliberate, `transport: 'stdio'` keeps it off the pooled path), so every op runs the LEGACY
 * branch. #419 stops that re-logging in per call, but the branch still re-selects and syncs more
 * eagerly than a pooled HTTP session, and once a throttled sync closes the budget (#396 shape)
 * the recovery costs a re-download plus a re-login, which is itself several requests.
 *
 * So the stdio leg is given a budget low enough that even a high ratio stays inside the ceiling.
 *
 * IT DOES BIND, and the averages say otherwise, so read this before "simplifying" it away. Review
 * argued the branch is inert: 112 calls over 2.4 minutes is ~47 calls per minute, which cannot
 * reach a 90-call budget. That reasoning uses the AVERAGE; the pacer uses a SLIDING 60-second
 * window and the suite is bursty, with the write-heavy block far denser than the mean. The
 * measurement settles it. Changing ONLY this number, with the dedicated server and the zero
 * cool-down already in place, took the stdio leg from 4 failures to 0 AND its wall clock from
 * 2.4 minutes to 5.2 minutes. A pacer that never slept could not have more than doubled the
 * runtime. The extra time IS the pacer holding calls back, which is the cost being paid.

 * neither can see the other's calls. That used to matter, because both drove one Actual server.
 * Since #423 they drive SEPARATE servers, so each leg genuinely does own the whole ceiling of the
 * server it talks to, and the cross-leg cool-down is no longer needed.
 *
 * What remains, and what the per-transport budget above is for: a leg can exceed the ceiling on
 * its own. Measured with the legs already separated, the stdio leg tripped the limiter while
 * holding this pacer zero times AT THE OLD 230 BUDGET. That is the observation that set the stdio
 * budget to 90, and at 90 it does hold: see the wall-clock evidence above. Read the two together,
