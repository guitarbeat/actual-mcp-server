Run the full local deployment pipeline for the actual-mcp-server dev environment.

## Usage

Accepted arguments: `[smoke|sanity|normal|extended|full] [--bank-sync]`
Default test level if no argument given: `smoke`

## Steps

1. Run the deploy script from the project root:

   ```bash
   cd <the repo root>          # the script derives its own paths from its location
   bash scripts/deploy-and-test.sh [ARGUMENTS]
   ```

   The path used to be written out here and in the script itself. Both rotted when
   the repo moved on 2026-09-04, so do NOT reintroduce an absolute path: the script
   now derives `DEV_DIR` from its own location and refuses to run if that is not a
   git working tree.

   - Valid test levels: `sanity` | `smoke` | `normal` | `extended` | `full`
   - Optional flag: `--bank-sync` to include per-account bank sync tests (GoCardless/SimpleFIN)

**Which budget the tests run against (since 2026-08-11).** The bearer instance
(:3601), which is what this pipeline tests, points at a DISPOSABLE budget via
`BEARER_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` in `$HOME/docker/librechat-MCP-actual/actual-mcp-server/.env`.
The OIDC instance (:3600, LibreChat/LobeChat) still serves the REAL budget through
`ACTUAL_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` and must not be repointed. At `full` the suite creates and
deletes objects, so running it against real financial data is not acceptable; before
this split it also meant the post-run zero-residue assertion failed on leftovers from
earlier runs, making the gate red for reasons unrelated to the change under test.

That same `.env` sets `MCP_TEST_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` to the same id, which designates the
budget disposable and is what allows the PRE-run residue sweep to delete leftovers
from a previously crashed run. `scripts/deploy-and-test.sh` reads it from there when
it is not already exported, and prints whether the sweep is enabled or disabled at
the start of the test step, so a skipped sweep is visible rather than silent.

**Do not derive `MCP_TEST_BUDGET_SYNC_ID` from the loaded budget.** The guard exists
because an operator deliberately named a budget as disposable AND that name matches
what the server loaded. Defaulting it to the loaded budget makes the comparison
always true and points a deleting sweep at whatever is mounted.

2. Stream all output to the user as it runs. The script will:
   - Sync latest dev code → Docker build folder & rebuild MCP image
   - Pull latest upstream images (Actual Budget, LibreChat, LobeChat)
   - Recreate both MCP containers (OIDC:3600 + Bearer:3601)
   - Restart LibreChat and LobeChat
   - Wait for the bearer MCP container to become healthy
   - Run HTTP integration tests against the bearer instance (port 3601)
   - Run a stdio smoke against the same container (`docker exec ... --stdio`) so both transports are exercised each run
   - At the `full` level only: run the #270 upstream-stall checks. The stdio regression (`scripts/regression-270-stall.mjs`) is GATED: it injects netem packet loss on the Actual server and asserts a stalled op rejects within a bounded time and releases the api mutex; while `scripts/known-failing/270` exists a reproduced hang is EXPECTED and does not fail the pipeline; deleting that marker (when #270 is fixed) makes it enforcing. The HTTP check (`scripts/diag-270-http.mjs`) is INFORMATIONAL only (never fails the pipeline): the StreamableHTTP client times out a stalled request on its own, so a client-observed rejection cannot prove the server released the mutex. The authoritative, transport-agnostic guarantee (server-side per-op timeout + lock release, shared by stdio and HTTP) is gated by the fast unit test `tests/unit/adapter_op_timeout.test.js` in `test:unit-js`.

3. After completion, summarize:
   - Which Docker images were updated vs already up to date
   - Whether all containers are healthy
   - HTTP integration test result (passed/failed + tool count verified)
   - stdio smoke result (passed/failed + tool count verified)
   - At `full` level: #270 regression result (correct / known-hang-expected / regression)
